# Asperato user documentation

Here lives the source for the Asperato user documentation, available at https://asperato.github.io/userdocs/. Unless you want to contribute to this documentation, you probably want to go there to [view it](https://asperato.github.io/userdocs/).

## Running the documentation locally
The documentation is based on [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). To clone and run locally:

 - Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 - Install yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable
 - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Asperato/userdocs.git`
 - Navigate into the website directory: `cd website`
 - Install dependencies: `npm install`
 - Start the server: `yarn start`

The server will run on port 3000. A livereload server will also start so changes should show up immediately.
