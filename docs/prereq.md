## Introduction
Asperato requires certain prerequisites in order to operate correctly; those prerequisites are outlined here. If you're not sure whether you can meet these prerequisites, or you need some clarification, please email support@asperato.com with any questions and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## Salesforce prerequisites
You must have a valid Salesforce Enterprise or Unlimited license in order to use Asperato ONE in a production setting. For testing and development purposes, Asperato ONE can also be used in a Salesforce developer org. Asperato ONE is not compatible with Salesforce Essentials or Salesforce Professional edition.

## PSP prequisites
For live running, you must have a compatible PSP connection that has been configured to take live payments.

Note that if you are using GoCardless, you must have a GoCardless Pro account (standard and plus accounts are not supported.)
